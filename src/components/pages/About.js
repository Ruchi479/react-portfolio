                <p> 
                  Hello, I'm Ruchi! I switched my gears from my education in Teaching to take on Web Development to keep challenging myself in ways I thought I never could. 
                  Web Development allows me to continually create and creatively find new ways to make processes better. I always believed that anything can be improved and 
                  there are different ways to solve problems. Web Development has never been "just a job" for me, it is offered an engaging challenge to continually learn,
                  teach, and improve my skills in creating good quality web sites.With that being said, I am Full Stack Web Developer based in India with a Masterâ€™s Degree combined with 
                  Graduate Coding BootCamp from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia and 4+ years professional Computer Science Teaching experience in India. I am a naturally curious person which makes me want to always learn new things. I am a problem-solver who 
                  questions everything. I am a hard worker who doesn't take life too seriously and enjoys the little things. You will always find a smile on my face.
